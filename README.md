# Generator level exercise

## Event trees structure

Small trees of signal and background samples that are relevant for the Higgs to Muon Tau analysis.  The trees contain slimmed generator level information based on HEPMC. 

The information skim is as follow: 
- All events are saved (no filtering), but not all the generator level particles produced in each event are kept.
- For each event, the particle variables are saved in a vector of doubles/ints: [particle 1, particle 2, particle 3,....]. Accessing the properties of particle X means reading the X index in the vector. Example:
    - pt--> [pt particle 1, pt particle 2, pt particle 3, pt particle 4, ... ] 
    - eta -> [eta particle 1, eta particle 2, eta particle 3, eta particle 4, ... ] 
- Particles saved: *Electrons (pdgID=11), Muons (pdgID=13), Taus (pdgID=15), Neutrinos (pdgID=12,14,16), Higgs (pdgID=25), Z boson (pdgID=23), W boson (pdgID=24)*.  (pdgID description: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2011/reviews/rpp2011-rev-monte-carlo-numbering.pdf )
- Quantities saved per particle: pt, eta, phi, mass, pdgID, status, motherPdgID, motherStatus, numberOfDaughters, decay (for taus only), ptvisible (also only for taus, in development)
- Pythia8 status:  
    - Electrons, Muons, and Neutrinos are saved only the final state (pythia status=1),  removing intermediate particles 
    - Taus are saved just before decay (status=2), and the decay information is kept in a "decay" flag that encodes the tau decay mode (posible values of the flag, ignoring neutrinos: 0=1pi+,0pi0 1=1pi+,1pi0  2=1pi+,2pi0 3=3pi+,0pi0 4=3pi+,1pi0 5=other hadronic decay; 11=electron decay, 13=muon decay. To investigate tau decays: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/tables/rpp2018-sum-leptons.pdf) 
    - Bosons are saved in the first state in which they appear (typically pythia values 21-29)
    - What is this status code?: information about the hadronization status of a particle in pythia, from the parton-parton hard interaction products to the final products which are observed in the detector.  http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia81html/ParticleProperties.html 
- Event variables: event number, generator level weight for aMC@NLO


## First exercises: plot muon pt from a HiggsToMuTau tree 

- To Run:  **python ExampleMuons.py**
- Two different ways to draw histograms from the information in a tree: tree->Draw, and a loop over the particles are compared
- The result of the program is double: a canvas is plotted (all particles vs muons), and a root file containing the plots is produced 

Exercises: 
- **Exercise 0**: get this program to run and inspect the results :)

- **Exercise 1**: plot different muon variables out of the ones available 
- **Exercise 2**: plot also taus and electrons 
- **Exercise 3**: what is the origin of the muons in the event? distinguish muons that are decayed from a tau and muons that aren't: are they similar? 
- **Exercise 4**: what is the origin of the electrons in the event? distinguish electrons that are decayed from a tau and electrons that aren't: are they similar? 
- **Exercise 5**: compare muons, taus and electrons : what can you say about the process you are studying?
